You are not required to purchase any of these books but you are encouraged to do so if you want a hard copy. The first two books are available for free online (HTML format) and you can read them online or download them as PDF files. The third book is not available in HTML.\n\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics by Çetinkaya-Rundel, Hardin. OpenIntro Inc., \\(2^{nd}\\) Edition, 2023. Hard copy available on Amazon.\nR for Data Science, 2e, Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, Grolemund. O’Reilly, 2nd edition, 2023. Hard copy available on Amazon.\nOpenIntro Statistics by David Diez, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, and Christopher Barr. OpenIntro Inc., \\(4^{th}\\) Edition, 2019. If you want a free copy, adjust the slider to 0. Hard copy available on Amazon.\n\n\n\nComputing:\n\nR: We will use R statistical environment with the RStudio interface. You’ll be using R primarily through a version of RStudio accessible on posit cloud. Once you are on this page, sign in or click on sign up to create a new account in case you don’t already have an account. Note that you may use R locally on your computer but this option may present many technical issues for beginners. If you choose to use R locally, follow the steps below:\n\nDownload and install R.\nDownload and install RStudio.\n\n\nNote that RStudio is not the same as R. RStudio is a convenient interface that makes it easier to write and run R code. That is why you have to install R, then install RStudio. You do not have to worry about this if you use the online version.\n\nOptional: You may want to have a scientific calculator (one that has the ability to compute powers–e.g., \\((1.675)^3)\\) to use when you want to do quick calculations. You may also use online calculator tools such as desmos.",

    "section": "Assessment",
    "text": "Assessment\nYour learning will be assessed in a variety of ways including Attendance and Participation (AP), CPA’s, Labs, Problem Sets (PS), Projects, Exams, and a final Portfolio (takes the place of a final exam). Below are the details on these components.\n\nAttendance and Participation (AP)\nYou’re expected to attend all classes and participate during class discussions. Consistent attendance and participation are strong indicators of success in MATH 144. You will be responsible for all course material, announcements, quizzes, and exams made in class, whether you attended that day’s class or not. I may post the announcements and materials on Canvas and/or send them out as emails. If you anticipate needing to miss more than four class sessions, please plan to meet so we discuss your options. Your attendance & participation will be gauged based on the following metrics:\n\nPunctuality to class and total number of classes attended\nPreparedness for class (you will generally be considered prepared if you do the CPAs).\nLevel of engagement: Includes working collaboratively with others, sharing your thoughts during class discussions, and asking/answering questions.\nContributing to online collaboration work and discussion forums.\n\nFor more details about the college attendance policy, see the college-wide policies section.\n\n\nClass Preparation Assignments (CPAs)\nCPAs are done prior to class. They involve completing short readings or activities and/or watching videos then answering a few questions based on the covered material. CPA’s are meant to get you prepared for the material of the week/day so that you can contribute meaningfully during class discussions. For this reason, deadlines for CPAs cannot be extended.\nNote: CPAs will generally be graded for completion and effort. From time to time, there will be one question on the CPA that will be graded for accuracy. This question is meant to gauge the extent to which you understood the material on your own and answers may be discussed in class.\n\n\nMyOpenMath Homework\nMyOpenMath is an online homework system that will be used for this course. You will be required to complete homework assignments on MyOpenMath about once a week for most of the semester. The homework assignments will be based on the material covered in class and in the readings. You are expected to complete all homework assignments by the due date (indicated on Canvas).\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply what you’ve learned in class to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, lab should be completed and submitted individually. Lab assignments will be submitted as reproducible reports, which allows someone else to rerun and check your analyses. You will learn more about this in class.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nQuizzes\nThere will be a short quiz in class almost every week (usually Fridays). The quiz will be based mainly on material learned in the CPA and/or discussed in class for the current or previous week. To do well in these quizzes, you should complete your CPAs accurately, and attend class. If there are concepts you have questions about, be sure to ask. All Quizzes will be closed book and closed notes.\n\n\nProjects\nThere will be two group projects for this class. For every project, a short proposal will be due roughly a week after the project is assigned. Your group will have 10-15 minutes to present your work in class and then submit the project report a day after presentation. Detailed information about the project, including a grading rubric, will be provided.\n\n\nMidterm Exams\nThere will be two mid-term exams during the semester. Each midterm exam will have an in class component and a take-home component.\n\nIn-class component: The in-class component will be closed-book and closed notes but calculators will be allowed (not on devices like cellphones and computers). You will be allowed to bring a 2-sided A4 size paper with your summary notes and/or formulas. Your sheet must contain your name and should be submitted alongside the exam.\nThe take-home component May require use of RStudio and will be availed in quarto (qmd) format. You will need to type in your answers into the quarto document and perform the analyses accordingly. You should submit a pdf format but if you face errors rendering due to errors in your code, you may submit the .qmd file.\n\nThe exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in CPAs, problem sets, quizzes, among others.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nThe final exam for this course will have two parts:\n\nFinal Portfolio: A portfolio with the following:\n\n\nRevised work (if necessary) on both mid-term exams. Again, you should point out the errors on every problem and explain how your revisions fix your errors.\nA reflective essay on your main takeaways from the course and how you may implement that knowledge in your field or other real-life situations.\n\n\nOral Presentation: You will be required to give a 10-minute oral presentation on a question related to the course content. This will be an individual presentation and you will be expected to use R to perform the analysis. The question will be sent to you at least 24 hours before your scheduled presentation time and solutions must be submitted to Canvas by 8.00 am on the day of the presentation. You should be prepared to answer questions from your peers and the instructor.\n\nMore information on the final Exam will be provided later in the semester.\n\n\nGrading Policy\nYour final letter grade in the course will be weighted by category as follows:\n\n\n\nCategory\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nAttendance and Participation\n__\n\n\nClass Preparation Assignments\n05%\n\n\nMyOpenMath Hw\n10%\n\n\nLabs\n10%\n\n\nQuizzes\n10%\n\n\nMidterm Exams\n30%\n\n\nProjects\n20%\n\n\nFinal Portfolio\n15%\n\n\n\nThe final letter grade will be determined based on the following thresholds:\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nFinal Course Grade\n\n\n\n\nA\n\\(\\ge\\) 93\n\n\nA-\n90 - 92.99\n\n\nB+\n87 - 89.99\n\n\nB\n83 - 86.99\n\n\nB-\n80 - 82.99\n\n\nC+\n77 - 79.99\n\n\nC\n73 - 76.99\n\n\nC-\n70 - 72.99\n\n\nD+\n67 - 69.99\n\n\nD\n63 - 66.99\n\n\nD-\n60 - 62.99\n\n\nF\n\\(&lt;\\) 60",

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nThe point is very simple - you should not cheat. You should not present “someone” else’s work (including generative AI) as your own.\nAbide by the following guidelines:\n\nCollaboration:\n\nWork that is not assigned as a collaborative assignment should not be completed collaboratively. This does not mean you should not seek support from peers. If you seek help from your peers, be sure that you write your own solutions, otherwise the work will be similar and flagged for cheating. Submitting similar work will be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy by all students involved.\nFor team assignments (e.g., projects), you may collaborate freely within your team. Each group will submit one document contained agreed upon responses. No multiple file submissions.\n\nOn individual assignments you may not directly share work with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share work with another team in this class.\n\nOnline resources: In this century, the internet is a go to place for many things. While much of the information on the internet is useful, I expect that you will use it responsibly. The course policy is that you may use online resources (e.g., StackOverflow, Wolfram Alpha, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any solutions you directly use (or use as inspiration).\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT should be treated as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:\n\nCognitive dimension: Using AI tools should make you more efficient and productive rather than hampering your ability to think clearly and critically.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n✅ AI tools for code: From time to time, I will demonstrate how to use AI for coding and will discuss how to use the tool responsibly without losing sight of the learning objectives.\n\nYou may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n\n❌ AI tools for narrative: You should not use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT to write narrative on assignments. Interpretation of software output, writing up the project report, among others should be written by a human (YOU). If you want to use these tools to check your grammar, you should feel free to do so but be sure to disclose and cite it accordingly.\n\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please contact your instructor.\n\n\nLate Work\nThe due date & time for all assignments will be posted on Canvas and/or emailed out and/or announced in class. To enable me to prepare for class meetings and give you feedback, I will not accept late work except under extreme circumstances. If you know that you won’t be able to turn in an assignment on time, reach out to me in writing (email) at least one day before the due date to discuss your options. Note that there will be no extensions on CPA’s.\n\n\nMobile devices & Other Technologies\nThis class allows use of technology devices (e.g., computers, tablets, etc.) only for purposes of the course. Such purpose involves data analysis, writing reports, completing OneNote collaborative activities, among others. However, there will be moments (e.g., brief interactive discussion, completing paper activities,) when I require that students put away (or turn off) their technology devices. Use of these devices for purposes other than the one for the course is prohibited. Research on this matter shows that it distracts you as well as other class members. Two violations per week will result in a 0 score on the next attendance and participation grade. Persistent violation may necessitate further action to prevent you from distracting other students.\n\n\nTeams\nThis class will mostly run through small group work (teams). You will be randomly assigned to a team at the start of the semester. About midway into the semester, I will switch people teams based partly on my professional judgement. I will allow you to suggest members you would like to work with but there are no guarantees that you will get grouped with all members of your choice. I generally seek to have mixed ability teams and to ensure that everyone has a chance to work with different people.",

    "title": "MATH 14400x Business Statistics",
    "section": "Tips for Success",
    "text": "Tips for Success\nHere are a few basic suggestions for how to succeed in this course:\n\nKeep up with Homework\nIt is absolutely essential that you understand how to solve the assigned homework problems/exercises and, more importantly, how and why the skills and techniques presented in the course are used in solving the problems/exercises. I suggest that you begin working on the how as soon as possible. Do not pile your haw or work near the deadline. The advantage of getting the homework done on time is that you will get timely feedback that will help you understand the material better and hence do well in other assessment categories such as exams.\n\n\nAttend Class\nAs noted earlier, attendance is a critical part of your success in this course. You should try to attend every class because it is during class time that we will delve deeper into the course material and practice with applications.\n\n\nStay Caught Up\nMost concepts in this course build on each other cumulatively and you need to stay on top of the material at every stage. If you are having difficulty, don’t expect that the problem will take care of itself and disappear later. Contact me immediately and discuss the problem.\n\n\nCollaborate with Peers\nMany students benefit from sharing their work with others or by having their work questioned by their peers. You should attempt homework problems ahead of time by yourself and then note down any difficulties/questions that you can discuss with your peers. Even if you have no difficulties, you may still learn different and perhaps more efficient ways of solving the same problem during collaborative work. Below are some of the ways through which you can do this: - Canvas Discussion Forums & One Note Collaboration Space - You can post questions and answer others’ questions here. I encourage you to scan hand-written work (if necessary) and upload it alongside your question so people can see how you are thinking.\n\nZoom sessions – If you cannot meet in person, you can initiate Zoom sessions for collaborating. Zoom whiteboards are available to write on or you may simply have discussions. You can record these for later playback. If you want to invite me to your Zoom session, please send me an email with the link ahead of time and I will let you know if I am available to join.",

    "title": "MATH 14400x Business Statistics",
    "section": "College-wide Policies",
    "text": "College-wide Policies\n\nAttendance Policy\nStudents at Ithaca College are expected to attend all classes, and they are responsible for work missed during any absence from class. At the beginning of each semester, instructors must provide the students in their courses with written guidelines regarding possible penalties for failure to attend class. These guidelines may vary from course to course but are subject to the following conditions:\n\nIn accordance with Federal Law, students with a disability documented through Student Accessibility Services (SAS) may require reasonable accommodations to ensure equitable access. A student with an attendance accommodation, who misses a scheduled course time due to a documented disability, must be provided an equivalent opportunity to make up missed time and/or coursework within a reasonable time-frame. An accommodation that affects attendance is not an attendance waiver and no accommodation can fundamentally alter a course requirement. If a faculty member thinks an attendance-related accommodation would result in a fundamental alteration, concerns and potential alternatives should be discussed with SAS.\nIn accordance with New York State law, students who miss class due to their religious beliefs shall be excused from class or examinations on that day. The faculty member is responsible for providing the student with an equivalent opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirement that the student may have missed. Any such work is to be completed within a reasonable time frame, as determined by the faculty member.\nAny student who misses class due to a family or individual health emergency or to a required appearance in a court of law shall be excused. If the emergency is prolonged or if the student is incapacitated, the student or a family member/legal guardian should report the absence to the Dean of Students or the Dean of the academic school where the student’s program is housed. Students may consider a leave of absence, medical leave of absence, selected course withdrawals, etc., if they miss a significant portion of classwork. (Note: Graduate students may not take a leave of absence.)\nA student may be excused to participate in local, state, or federal elections. The student is responsible to make up any work that is missed due to the absence. Any such work is to be completed within a reasonable time frame, as determined by the faculty member.\n\nA student may be excused for participation in College-authorized co-curricular and extracurricular activities if, in the instructor’s judgment, this does not impair the specific student’s or the other students’ ability to succeed in the course. For all absences except those due to religious beliefs, the course instructor has the right to determine if the number of absences has been excessive in view of the nature of the class that was missed and the stated attendance policy.\nStudents should notify their instructors as soon as possible of any anticipated absences.\n\n\nStudent Accessibility Services\nIn compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, reasonable accommodation will be provided to students with documented disabilities on a case-by-case basis. Students must register with Student Accessibility Services and provide appropriate documentation to Ithaca College before any academic adjustment will be provided. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive, so timely contact with Student Accessibility Services is encouraged. To discuss accommodations or the accommodation process, students should schedule to meet with a SAS specialist. 607-274-1005 | sas@ithaca.edu.\n\n\nMental Health statement\nThe Ithaca College Center for Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) promotes and fosters the academic, personal, and interpersonal development of Ithaca College students by providing short-term individual, group, and relationship counseling, crisis intervention, educational programs to the campus community, and consultation for faculty, staff, parents, and students. Their team of licensed and licensed-eligible professionals value inclusivity, and they are dedicated to creating a diverse, accessible, and welcoming environment that is safe and comfortable for all those they serve and with whom they interact. CAPS sees students in-person at their offices in the Hammond Health building (side entrance), but Telehealth meetings through Zoom can be arranged in some circumstances. Staff in the office will answer questions by phone at 607-274-3136; please leave a voicemail if you do not reach a live person. You can also reach the office via email at counseling@ithaca.edu. CAPS hours remain Monday-Friday 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. After-hours connections to a live counselor are available by calling the CAPS number and following the prompts.\nIn the event I suspect you need additional support, expect that I will express to you my concerns. It is not my intent to know the details of what might be troubling you, but simply to let you know I am concerned and that help, if needed, is available. Remember, getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe College is an academic community, which values academic integrity and takes seriously its responsibility for upholding academic honesty. All members of the academic community have an obligation to uphold high intellectual and ethical standards. All forms of dishonesty including cheating and plagiarism are unacceptable. Failure to appropriately cite material used in a paper is plagiarism. The minimum penalty for cheating or plagiarism is a zero for the test or paper in question. Referral to college judiciaries is also possible. For more information on academic integrity and academic dishonesty, please refer to the Student Handbook, the College Catalog and the Code of Student Conduct and Related Policies or ask your instructor.\n\n\nTitle IX\nAt Ithaca College, we believe that every individual has the right to be treated with respect and dignity and we support the creation and maintenance of a safe and positive living and learning environment. Students who experience sexual violence (including dating violence, stalking and sexual assault), sexual harassment, or discrimination based on gender or sexual identity) are encouraged to report their experience to the Title IX Coordinator, lkoenig@ithaca.edu to explore formal and informal reporting options, and explore the support and resources available. The Title IX Coordinator will work with you to determine the best way to proceed and enhance the safety of our community. For more information go to: https://www.ithaca.edu/share.\nInformation shared in class assignments, class discussions, and at public events do not constitute an official disclosure, and faculty and staff do not have to report these to the Title IX Coordinator. Faculty and staff should be sure that access to campus and community resources related to sexual misconduct are available to students in the case these subjects do arise. Any other disclosure to faculty and staff can be reported to the Title IX Coordinator.\n\n\nAcademic Advising Center\nStudents are asked to consult with their faculty advisor, or the advising contact within their school, for all advising matters. Faculty advisors will be able to assist students with most advising questions, or they may collaborate with the dean’s office for more complicated matters. Students can find the name of their assigned faculty advisor in Homer or in Degree Works.\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\nIthaca College values diversity because it enriches our community and the myriad experiences that characterize an Ithaca College education. Diversity encompasses multiple dimensions, including but not limited to race, culture, nationality, ethnicity, religion, ideas, beliefs, geographic origin, class, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and expression, disability, and age. We are dedicated to addressing current and past injustices and promoting excellence and equity. Ithaca College continually strives to build an inclusive and welcoming community of individuals with diverse talents and skills from a multitude of backgrounds who are committed to civility, mutual respect, social justice, and the free and open exchange of ideas. We commit ourselves to change, growth, and actions that embrace diversity as an integral part of the educational experience and of the community we create.Please learn more about Ithaca College’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion: https://www.ithaca.edu/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-statement.",

If you’ve selected just a single file, it will only download that. The downloaded file will go to wherever files you download off the internet goes on your computer (usually your Downloads folder).\n\nQuestion: How do I upload a quarto file (.qmd) to RStudio cloud? Easy! Just go to your Files tab, click on the blue Upload button, and select the file you want to upload. RStudio will upload the file and you can then open it by clicking on it. Watch the following video for a demonstration:\n\nQuestion: How do I upload a data file into RStudio on posit cloud?\nThe process involves uploading the file into the RStudio directory (files section)and then creating a path for quarto to access the data. If you don’t do this, the analyses may run but the document may not render. Watch the video below:\n\nQuestion: How do I submit my assignment to Canvas?\nThe instructions for submitting your assignment to Canvas can be found here. Please preview your submission to make sure it is the correct file before submitting.",

    "section": "Local R Installation vs posit cloud",
    "text": "Local R Installation vs posit cloud\nQuestion: Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the course TA are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the posit cloud. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nInstall Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"xxx\"), where xxx is the name of the package.\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the online computing environment (posit cloud).",

    "title": "Hello, World!",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It is possible that some of you have heard/seen the phrase, Hello, World!, before. That is usually the first thing you learn in programming, i.e., to learn to write a computer program to print this sentence to screen. In this course, we will not print Hello, World! to the screen. Instead, we will learn how to use R (via RStudio) to perform statistical analyses and to write reports in order to communicate the insights learned from data. While the analysis involves writing computer code, it is in no way going to involve writing computer programs. The goal of today’s lab is to introduce you to R and RStudio. You will learn to access and use RStudio, as well as perform the basic functions regarding statistical analysis. To clarify which is which: R is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface (Integrated Development Environment or IDE) for working with R. I like to think about R as the car engine and RStudio as a nice driver dashboard. The engine drives the car, but the dashboard makes it easier for the driver to control the car. Most R users work with RStudio.\n\n\n\nCar Engine and Dashboard\n\n\nWe will work with the cloud (online) version of RStudio.\n\n\nTo access RStudio online, click on the link https://posit.cloud to create an account or to sign in if you already have an account.\n\n\n\nAfter signing in to R studio, our next step is to create a new project. You can think of a project as a folder or simply a collection of files/files with a specific goal in mind. Our project will be called “MATH 144 Fall 2025”. The labs that you do will be saved in this project. To create the project, you start by clicking on “New Project” and then change the default name (UNTITLED PROJECT) to “MATH 144 Fall 2025”.\nYay! You now have your project ready.\nNote that you won’t have to create a project from scratch every time you open RStudio. All labs will be done inside this project that we just created.\nIn the next section, we explain the meaning of the various panels on your screen.\n\n\n\nYour new R studio project interface will look as follows:\n\n\nLeft Panel: The panel on the left is where the action happens. This panel is called the console. Every time you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the console telling you the version of R that you’re running. Below that information is the symbol ” &gt; “. This is where you enter your commands. When you enter and execute a command, the output will come right below it. These commands and their syntax have evolved over decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a fairly natural way to access data, organize, describe, and invoke statistical computations. Try typing 1 + 1 in the console and hit enter.\n\n\nCode\n1+1\n\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nUpper Right Panel: The panel in the upper right is called “environment”. It contains, among other things, the history of the actions or commands that you’ve previously entered.\nBottom Right Panel: The panel in the lower right contains tabs for browsing the files in your project folder, access help files for R functions, install and manage R packages, and inspecting visualizations through the viewer tab. By default, all data visualizations you make will appear directly below the code you used to create them. If you would rather your plots appear in the plots tab, you will need to change your global options.\n\n\n\nWe want to create a new file (an R script) to write our code. To create a new file, click on the “File” menu, then click on “New File”, and then click on “R Script”. A new tab will open in the left panel. This is where you will write your code. You can save this file by clicking on the “File” menu and then clicking on “Save”. Save the file as “lab_1_Explorations”. If you did this correctly, a new file will appear under the files section (lower right) of the project.\n\n\n\nIn R, a function is piece of code that performs a specific task. Functions take inputs (called arguments) and return outputs. For example, the mean() function takes a series of numerical values as the input and returns their average. Try running the following code:\n\n\nCode\nmean(3,4,5)\n\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nThe inputs of a function are called arguments. Here, we have three arguments (3, 4, and 5). Note that the arguments are separated by commas. The general syntax for a function is function_name(argument1, argument2, ...). In this case, mean is the function name and 3, 4, and 5 are the arguments.\nYou will learn more about functions and arguments as we progress through the course. For now, it is important to understand that functions are the building blocks of R programming, and they allow you to perform complex tasks with simple commands.\n\n\n\n\nR is an open-source programming language, meaning that users can contribute packages that make our lives easier, and we can use them for free. Packages are simply pre-written code meant to serve specific purposes and may contain other packages inside them. Packages may also contain data sets. Packages are stored in a directory called Library. For most labs in this course, we will use the following two packages:\n\nThe tidyverse package is a very popular “umbrella” package which houses a suite of many different R packages: for data wrangling (including tidying) and data visualization.\nThe openintro package for data and custom functions with the openintro resources. You will notice that the readings frequently refer to data contained in the openintro Package. This is the package.\n\n\n\nWe now want to install packages in our project. To install a package in R, we can use the function install.packages and the package name as the argument as shown below:\ninstall.packages(\"package name\")\nWe run this command in the console because we only need to install packages once per project. After installing a package, we need to load (activate) it each time we relaunch RStudio.\nTo install tidyverse, run the following code in the console:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nExercise: What code would you use to install the openintro package? Install the package.\nNote: To launch (activate) the tidyverse package, we use the following command:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nWhy Tidyverse? We are choosing to use the tidyverse package collection because it consists of a set of packages necessary for different aspects of working with data, anything from loading data to wrangling data to visualizing data to analyzing data. Additionally, these packages share common philosophies and are designed to work together. The tidyverse workflow makes coding feel like a natural language. You can find more about the packages in the tidyverse at tidyverse.org.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we want to find the mean of the numbers 23,24,26,19,18,25,21, and 39. You can use the command mean(23,24,...), but this might not be the most efficient way if the list is long. A common thing to do is to create a container to put all these numbers. Such a container is known as a vector. Specifically, this is a numerical vector. See code below for creating a vector consisting of the above list:\n\n\nCode\nx &lt;- c(23,24,26,19,18,25,21, 39) \n# We use the symbol '&lt;-' for assigning elements to an object. \n\n\nHere, we are creating a vector and storing it in an object called x. The symbols &lt;- is used for assignment. In R, we use a # to designate a comment (text that should not be evaluated as code). In above chunk, the text after # is a comment. Comments are a good way to document your code.\nTo find the mean of those numbers, we simply run the command mean(x) as shown below.\n\n\nCode\nmean(x)\n\n\n[1] 24.375\n\n\nTo find the median of the numbers, we run the command median(x) as shown below.\n\n\nCode\nmedian(x)\n\n\n[1] 23.5\n\n\nWe can also create a string object (i.e., a series of non-numerical elements or characters). We use quotes for string characters. See below:\n\n\nCode\ny &lt;- c( \"Jane\", \"John\", \"Jess\", \"Jeff\", \"Joe\", \"Holli\", \"Henry\", \"Han\") \n# We use quotes for strings.\n\n\nNow, try to run the command mean(y):\n\n\nCode\nmean(y)\n\n\nWarning in mean.default(y): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\n\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nDid you get an error message in red?\nWell, programming languages generally produce error messages when you try to perform an inappropriate operation or if there is a mistake in the code. Error messages are a good way to learn what you did wrong. In this case, the mean/average of the object y does not make sense because the entries of y are not numerical.\nYou can, however, perform other operations on y. For example, you can use the table function to tabulate the entries in y. This may be useful in cases where one is interested in the frequencies of each entry. Run the command below:\n\n\nCode\ntable(y)\n\n\ny\n  Han Henry Holli  Jane  Jeff  Jess   Joe  John \n    1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1 \n\n\nThis is known as a frequency table.

Every time you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the console telling you the version of R that you’re running. Below that information is the symbol ” &gt; “. This is where you enter your commands. When you enter and execute a command, the output will come right below it. These commands and their syntax have evolved over decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a fairly natural way to access data, organize, describe, and invoke statistical computations. Try typing 1 + 1 in the console and hit enter.\n\n\nCode\n1+1\n\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nUpper Right Panel: The panel in the upper right is called “environment”. It contains, among other things, the history of the actions or commands that you’ve previously entered.\nBottom Right Panel: The panel in the lower right contains tabs for browsing the files in your project folder, access help files for R functions, install and manage R packages, and inspecting visualizations through the viewer tab. By default, all data visualizations you make will appear directly below the code you used to create them. If you would rather your plots appear in the plots tab, you will need to change your global options.\n\n\n\nWe want to create a new file (an R script) to write our code. To create a new file, click on the “File” menu, then click on “New File”, and then click on “R Script”. A new tab will open in the left panel. This is where you will write your code. You can save this file by clicking on the “File” menu and then clicking on “Save”. Save the file as “lab_1_Explorations”. If you did this correctly, a new file will appear under the files section (lower right) of the project.\n\n\n\nIn R, a function is piece of code that performs a specific task. Functions take inputs (called arguments) and return outputs. For example, the mean() function takes a series of numerical values as the input and returns their average. Try running the following code:\n\n\nCode\nmean(3,4,5)\n\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nThe inputs of a function are called arguments. Here, we have three arguments (3, 4, and 5). Note that the arguments are separated by commas. The general syntax for a function is function_name(argument1, argument2, ...). In this case, mean is the function name and 3, 4, and 5 are the arguments.\nYou will learn more about functions and arguments as we progress through the course. For now, it is important to understand that functions are the building blocks of R programming, and they allow you to perform complex tasks with simple commands.",

    "text": "Suppose we want to find the mean of the numbers 23,24,26,19,18,25,21, and 39. You can use the command mean(23,24,...), but this might not be the most efficient way if the list is long. A common thing to do is to create a container to put all these numbers. Such a container is known as a vector. Specifically, this is a numerical vector. See code below for creating a vector consisting of the above list:\n\n\nCode\nx &lt;- c(23,24,26,19,18,25,21, 39) \n# We use the symbol '&lt;-' for assigning elements to an object. \n\n\nHere, we are creating a vector and storing it in an object called x. The symbols &lt;- is used for assignment. In R, we use a # to designate a comment (text that should not be evaluated as code). In above chunk, the text after # is a comment. Comments are a good way to document your code.\nTo find the mean of those numbers, we simply run the command mean(x) as shown below.\n\n\nCode\nmean(x)\n\n\n[1] 24.375\n\n\nTo find the median of the numbers, we run the command median(x) as shown below.\n\n\nCode\nmedian(x)\n\n\n[1] 23.5\n\n\nWe can also create a string object (i.e., a series of non-numerical elements or characters). We use quotes for string characters. See below:\n\n\nCode\ny &lt;- c( \"Jane\", \"John\", \"Jess\", \"Jeff\", \"Joe\", \"Holli\", \"Henry\", \"Han\") \n# We use quotes for strings.\n\n\nNow, try to run the command mean(y):\n\n\nCode\nmean(y)\n\n\nWarning in mean.default(y): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\n\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nDid you get an error message in red?\nWell, programming languages generally produce error messages when you try to perform an inappropriate operation or if there is a mistake in the code. Error messages are a good way to learn what you did wrong. In this case, the mean/average of the object y does not make sense because the entries of y are not numerical.\nYou can, however, perform other operations on y. For example, you can use the table function to tabulate the entries in y. This may be useful in cases where one is interested in the frequencies of each entry. Run the command below:\n\n\nCode\ntable(y)\n\n\ny\n  Han Henry Holli  Jane  Jeff  Jess   Joe  John \n    1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1 \n\n\nThis is known as a frequency table. For example, we see that there is only one Jane entry in y. While you could easily count the number of Jane entries in y, the table function is useful when you have bigger data sets.\nDelete (or comment out) the mean(y) that you had written earlier.",

    "text": "Parts of a Quarto file\nA quarto file has three main parts - the YAML header, plain text and code chunks. See details below:\n\nYAML Header\nThe YAML header is the part of the document that contains metadata about the document. It is located at the top of the document and is enclosed by three dashes (---) at the beginning and end. The YAML header contains information such as the title of the document, author name, date, output format, and other options that control how the document is rendered. Here is an example of a YAML header:\n---\ntitle: \"My Analysis Report\"\nauthor: \"John Smith\"\nformat: html\n---\nNotice that the YAML header is written in a specific format called YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language). Each line in the YAML header consists of a key-value pair, where the key is followed by a colon (:) and the value. The keys and values are case-sensitive, and the values can be strings, numbers, booleans, or lists. For example, the title key has a string/character value of “My Analysis Report”, the author key has a string value of “John Smith”, and the format key has a string value of html (no quotes for format).\n\n\nPlain Text\nPlain text is the part of the document that contains the main content of the report. It is written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using simple syntax. For example, when you are in source mode you can use # to create headings, * or _ to create emphasis (italic or bold), and - or * to create lists. When in visual mode, it is easier to create these by using point and click options on the menu bar. It is often helpful to switch between the modes.\n\n\nCode Chunks\nCode chunks are the part of the document that contains the R code used to perform the analysis. In source mode, code chunks are enclosed by three back ticks (```) at the beginning and end, and they can be customized using various options. You can add a new chunk by clicking on the green plus sign on the menu bar and selecting R as the language. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (Windows) or Cmd + Option + I (Mac) to insert a new code chunk.

Specifically, we will find the measures of center (mean and median) and measures of location such as quartiles and interpret these in context. We will use base R approach as well as functions from the dplyr package (part of the tidyverse package).\n\nBase R Approach\nTo get the mean of the price variable, we copy and paste the following code in a new code chunk:\nmean(duke_forest$price)\nThe $ operator is used to extract a variable from a data frame. In this case, we are extracting the price variable from the duke_forest data frame.\n\n\nTidyverse/dplyr Approach\nTo find the mean of the price variable using the dplyr package, we use the summarize() function. Copy and paste the following code in a new code chunk:\nduke_forest |&gt;\n  summarize(mean(price))\nThe |&gt; symbol is known as the pipe operator. It is used to pass the output of one function to another function. In this case, we are passing the duke_forest data frame to the summarize() function.\nTidyverse uses the pipe operator a lot. Code written in this manner is (arguably) easier to read than the base R format. Not also that base R code can be quite cumbersome especially as you add more arguments.\nFor the most part, will use the Tidyverse workflow in this course.\nTo find the median of the price variable using both approaches, we proceed as follows:\n# Base R approach\nmedian(duke_forest$price)\n# Tidyverse approach\nduke_forest |&gt;\n  summarize(median(price))\nTo find the first quartile of the price variable using both approaches, we proceed as follows:\n# Base R approach\nquantile(duke_forest$price, 0.25)\n# Tidyverse approach\nduke_forest |&gt;\n  summarize(quantile(price, 0.25))\nTo find the third quartile, you can replace 0.25 with 0.75 in the code above.\nTo find the minimum value of the price variable using both approaches, we proceed as follows:\n# Base R approach\nmin(duke_forest$price)\n# Tidyverse approach\nduke_forest |&gt;\n  summarize(min(price)\nYou can find the maximum value of the price variable by replacing min() with max() accordingly.\n\n\n5-Number Summary and Boxplots\nA box plot is a graphical representation of the five-number summary of a numerical variable. It shows the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum of the variable. To create a boxplot of the price variable, we can use the boxplot() function as shown below.\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(duke_forest$price)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this code uses base R approach. We will learn to create boxplots using ggplot2 (part of the tidyverse package) in a later lab. Based on the box plot above, how would you describe the distribution of the price of the homes?",

It provides a programmatic interface for specifying what variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual properties.

    "section": "Data Visualization: Numerical Variables",
    "text": "Data Visualization: Numerical Variables\n\nOne Numerical Variable\nIn Lab 2, we computed numerical summary statistics using the variable price in the duke_forest data set. You also learned about base R and Tidyverse approaches for finding the statistics. In this lab, we demonstrate how to use the ggplot2 package to create various visualizations for the price variable.\n\nDot Plot\nThere are three basic steps in creating visualizations using ggplot2. The function is called ggplot(). The steps include:\n\nStep 1: Add the data argument and set the value to the data set name as shown below then run the code. You will notice a blank canvas.\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = duke_forest)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Add variables using the mapping argument and the sub function aes (aesthetics). This step defines how variables should be mapped on the axes. Since we are dealing with one variable here (price), we will just use the \\(x-axis\\). See code below:\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = price)\n       )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Define the visual properties. To define the visual properties, we use the geom (short form for geometry) function. In our case, we want to use dotplot and so we add the function geom_dotplot(). Notice that you must have the parentheses because this is a function that can take more arguments (you will learn more about this) to further define the nature of the dots added.\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = price)\n       ) + \n       geom_dotplot()\n\n\nBin width defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data. Pick better value with\n`binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nAnother tool we can use to visualize the distribution of a single numerical variable is a histogram. To create a histogram for the price variable, we follow the exact same steps as above but only change the geom_dotplot part to geom_histogram. See below:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = price)\n       ) + \n       geom_histogram()\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot\nWe can also create a boxplot in the same way but change the geometry to geom_boxplot. See below:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x=price)\n       ) + \n       geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nBy examining the tools created above, how would you describe the distribution of the prices? What is the advantages of dot plot over the histogram? What about the box plot over the histogram?\nIn Lab 2, we computed the mean as one of the numerical summary statistics for the price. Do you think the mean is a good measure of the typical house price in Duke Forest? Why or why not?\n\nMeasure of Spread\nYou can compute various measures of spread using the summarise function. For example, to compute the variance for the price variable, you can use the code below:\n\n\nCode\nduke_forest |&gt; \n  summarise(var(price))\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `var(price)`\n         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 50826826193.\n\n\nTo find the standard deviation, take the square root of variance or use the function below:\n\n\nCode\nduke_forest |&gt; \n  summarise(sd(price))\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sd(price)`\n        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     225448.\n\n\nTo find the first and third quartiles in one step, you can use the quantile function as shown below:\n\n\nCode\nduke_forest |&gt; \n  summarise(quantile(price, 0.25),\n            quantile(price, 0.75))\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  `quantile(price, 0.25)` `quantile(price, 0.75)`\n                    &lt;dbl&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1                  450625                  643750\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Numerical Variables\n\nScatter Plots\nIn many cases, we want to assess relationships between two numerical variables. A scatter plot is the most commonly used visualization tool for this. To create a scatter plot, you just need to specify the variable on the \\(x-axis\\) and the one on the \\(y-axis\\). In addition, you will use geom_point as the geometry.\nSuppose we want to assess the association between price and area. You can achieve this by using the below. Take a moment to study this code before you run it.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = area, y = price)\n       ) + \n       geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion - What pattern do you notice from the above scatter plot? Is this what you expected?\nYou can add some layer of complexity to the scatter plot to allow you compare three variables. For example, you may want to compare the relationship between price and area by cooling. To do this, you use the color argument as shown below:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x=area, y = price, color = cooling)\n       ) + \n       geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion - What do you notice in this new scatter plot that you did not notice in the previous one?"

    "text": "Data Visualization: Categorical Variables\n\nSingle categorical Variable\nYou can visualize a single categorical variable using tools such as simple bar plots and pie charts.\n\n\nSimple Bar Plot\nOne of the categorical variables in the duke_forest data set is cooling (central air vs other). Suppose we want to visualize the distribution of the houses by the type of cooling. The variable named cooling has values central air or other. We follow the same steps as for creating a dot plot, but change the geometry to geom_bar(). See code below:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = cooling)\n       ) + \n       geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar plot shows that there are slightly fewer houses with central air cooling system that those with “other” types of cooling systems.\nIn case you want to color the bars by cooling, you can use the fill argument inside the aes function as shown below the bars using some colors. See below:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = cooling, fill=cooling)\n       ) + \n       geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Categorical Variables\nWe can use stacked bar plots or side-by-side bar plots to visualize two categorical variables. For example, to visualize the relationship between cooling and heating, we can simply fill the bars by heating as shown below:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = cooling, fill = heating)\n       ) +\n       geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization is not easy to interpret. Using side-by-side (or dodged) bar plots may be a better option. To do this, we just add the position argument inside the geom_bar() function as shown below:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = cooling, fill = heating)\n       ) +\n       geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")"
